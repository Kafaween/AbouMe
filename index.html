            <p><h1>Who Am I</h1></p>
            <p><h3 id="par1">I`m Tamim Ashour, 34, wells completions engineer, and business entrepreneur .

                I was exited to join this camp,
                in order to build and develop coding skills that will directly
                add enhancement and improvement to startups I`m involved in,
                also looking forward to gain the access into more advanced fields in the industry.
            </h3></p>
            <p><h3 id="par2">2008 graduated from Jordan University with a degree in Applied Geology, and I got the chance to work 
                in different projects, mainly in the oil field, and I was lucky to work with global company SHELL 
                for 6 years, during that period I managed to add another degree to my portfolio from Shell university 
                in Netherlands, in Oil Wells Completion engineering & design.
                For me working in Oil field was fun and tough at the same time, during that time I recognized my tendency toward 
                technology specially softwares, I used to read about it everytime I had a chance, I learned some Python, 
                by myself.
                
            </h3></p>
            <p><h3 id="par3">Later on I had some attempts to jump inside some startups in the technology, only to keep 
                updated, till I had my own attempts in the field, and usually I used to use other developers 
                in order to achieve the project`s goals.
                Now I`m involved in two early stages startups one is a virtual education platform called 
                3abkari.com, the other one is smart device including electronics and softwares.
